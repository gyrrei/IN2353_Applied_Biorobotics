<li>I first didn't understand the description of control objectives and was confused. But in the common discussion part, I later understood more what it was.</li>
<li>I liked that we had some time to discuss the assignment because there were several questions that helped to understand smaller problems better.</li>
<li>Better and clearer description of control objectives, but otherwise no comments.</li>

<li>What content were you missing/should be more extensive?<br>Found everything covered, except for more about Johnny, but we went and had a look at it.</li>
<li>What did you like?<br>I liked the fact that we could have an excursion and see for ourselves current research projects.</li>
<li>What could be improved?<br>If we could have seen a simulation (test trial) with Lola walking, but I understand that that was not possible.</li>

            <ol><li>It was very interesting to get a clearer overview and more explanation of the other robot types. There were concepts and examples that I hadn't quite understood but got a better understanding of now. </li>
<li>However, I didn't quite grasp the ZMP theory, and I thought it was very good of the professor to point that out. </li>
<li>I liked both the feedback for the presentations. It was precise and justified. Additionally, I liked the feedback theory to prepare us and raise awareness on how to give and get good feedback.</li>
<li>I might have expected more of myself and the other presenters in preparation for presenting. That could be improved</li>

<ol><li>I found it very interesting to see and hear how far we still have left in terms of actuators, control and material science until we have a completely biological locomotion.</li>

<li>I was very impressed by Dr. Alexander Spoewitz, all that he knew and how well he conveyed the information with examples and questions. </li>

            <ol><li>I found the explanation and perspectives of the other groups very interesting and gave me an even clearer view of my own type of robot. The summary of the pro/cons/questions was also helpful to get the overview.</li>
<li>Would love to have the updated plan for the dates for the rest of the semester uploaded. </li>
<li>I liked the explanation of the stability. I had tried (briefly) to look it up when I saw the video but didn't get a grip on what it meant in one dimension. </li>

            <ol><li>I found particularly interesting, the part where you described the (striking) similarities between the spring model and real data of the human locomotion and the difference between walking and running.</li>
<li>Didn't miss anything.</li>
<li>I liked that we got feedback for the presentations on what to look further into and the relation between our bouncing mass problem and the actual force patterns of walking.</li>
<li>This might be more of an feedback for the other students, but as the requirement for the presentation was 5-7min we could have kept the time better. Neither of the groups got feedback that it was too long although all of them were. Maybe the timing needs to be better adapted?  </li>

            <ol><li>I found the brainstorming about robots interesting seeing the "gap" of what we know and what we will find out. It triggered my curiosity. </li>
<li>See no. 4.</li>
<li>I also liked the introduction with the theory of the Bloom's taxonomy. It both illustrated well the different steps of learning and got us more conscious of our own learning process. </li>
<li>Although we had written the essay about biorobotics and then naturally came over some opinions, I found the entry to the pros/cons discussion confusing. The assignment was to research definitions and approaches and not opinions. I started questioning if I had interpreted the assignment wrong. I feel I could have been better prepared and structured if I had known that the discussion was to be about pros and cons of biorobotics. But the discussion in the groups first and the iterative process helped to find arguments. </li>
